Because these calculations are being carried out by a computer (instead of by a human), we sometimes call them **computations**, instead. When we use lots of computations in sequence to study a physics problem, we call it **computational physics** (as opposed to theoretical or experimental physics). Similarly if you use computation in biology we call it **computational biology**.\n",

Sometimes Matlab's error messages will tell you exactly what you need to fix; other times, you'll have to dig around. But either way, the goal is to help make your code better.\n",
